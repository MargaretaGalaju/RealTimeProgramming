# Lab2

What is already done:
1. A new worker that computes the engagement ratio per tweet
2. An aggregator who combine into a single object the sentiment score & the engagment ratio of the same tweet
3. The backpressure mechanism - adaptive batching
4. Tried to load all this data in Mongo, but it failed :| (even if locally my database works and I can manipulate with its data....)
